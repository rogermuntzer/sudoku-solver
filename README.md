# sudoku-solver
A web-based sudoku solver, just type in the known numbers in a puzzle and it will work out the answer for you.

Created to learn how to use more complex JavaScript, the project originally worked exclusively in the code editor using the console log.
It now has a web GUI and simple animation to show how it works.
